IDEMPIERE IS A COMMUNITY PROJECT THAT RESPECTS AND PROTECTS CONTRIBUTIONS AND MAINTAINS ALL CREDITS IN PLACE HERE IN ITS OFFICIAL REPOSITORY. ALSO WE OBEY THE GPL LAW THAT BASICALLY SAYS 'YOU ARE FREE TO MODIFY THE SOURCE BUT SHARE BACK THE CHANGES'. IF NOT KINDLY INFORM US. (Please write to red1@red1.org).
HOWEVER ALL SOURCE GOES THROUGH STRICT PEER REVIEW BEFORE MAKING IT TO THE CORE. (Please check http://ci.idempiere.org/)

AS WE ARE USING THE OSGI PLUGIN APPROACH, A MARKETPLACE OF INDEPENDENT PLUGINS THAT ARE LOOSELY COUPLED TO THE CORE IS NOW POSSIBLE WITHOUT IMPACTING THE CORE THUS REDUCING ITS BLOAT (Please do so at http://wiki.idempiere.org/en/Category:Available_Plugins)

WE WORK WELL DOCUMENTING ISSUES (Please do so at https://idempiere.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa)

ALL COMMUNICATION REGARDING CODE IS APPRECIATED AT https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/idempiere.
