!2 Introduction
#
In ''!-FitLibrary-!'', one or more tables are used to specify business rules and processes.

Tables are used for two important reasons:

 * They help to clarify the language of the domain
 * They provide a structure in which feedback is provided, such as whether a test passed or not.

As we'll see in the following, tables are used in several different ways.
#
!2 Business Rules
#
A rule table is a way of defining, and testing, a business rule by providing several examples.

|>FirstRuleTableExample|''Discount business rules''|
|>SecondRuleTableExample|''Credit limit rules''|

Another approach to rules tables is here: .FitLibrary.UserGuide.FitLibraryByExample.CalculationRule
#
!2 Business Processes
#
A business process concerns the order that things happen, and their consequences.

A workflow storytest shows what happens when an action is carried out on the system. The action could be carried out by:
 * A user through a user interface
 * Another system that sends or requests data and gives some signal
 * An automatic background process that happens at certain times, such as every 10 minutes or at the end of the day

Sometimes, some of the tables used in defining a business process will specify the details of a single business object, such as a Customer.

Or we may want to deal with collections of things, such as a list of customers who owe us more than $10,000.
