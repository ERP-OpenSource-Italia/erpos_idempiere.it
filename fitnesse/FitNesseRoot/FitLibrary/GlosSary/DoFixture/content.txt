This interprets tables of ${workflow}.

Workflow storytests specify the step-by-step processing of a business process, or part of such a process. Such storytests are best expressed in a more abstract form than the actions through a user interface.

An extended form of ${doFixture} is ${domainFixture}.

See:
 * .FitLibrary.UserGuide.FitLibraryByExample.WorkFlow (where ${doFixture} is used in the middle, actions, phase)
!3 Note
This is supported by ${doTraverse}
