This ${traverse} interprets tables of ${workflow}.

Workflow storytests specify the step-by-step processing of a business process, or part of such a process. Such storytests are best expressed in a more abstract form than the actions through a user interface.

An extended form of ${doTraverse} is ${domainTraverse}.

See:
 * .FitLibrary.UserGuide.FitLibraryByExample.WorkFlow

This supports the functionality of ${doFixture}
