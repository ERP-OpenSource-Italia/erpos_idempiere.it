FitLibrary in Java was developed by Rick Mugridge, http://www.rimuresearch.com, in 2004. It gained initial attention with ''!-DoFixture-!'', a Fit fixture that expressed workflow storytests in a more compact form than ''!-ActionFixture-!'' one of the three main fixtures of Fit.

Rick has evolved FitLibrary considerably since 2004.

It was originally based on Fit. Since August 2006, it can operate independently of Fit, but it still can inter-operate with Fit.

There are ports (or reimplementations) to other languages for earlier versions of FitLibrary: see OtherLanguages.
