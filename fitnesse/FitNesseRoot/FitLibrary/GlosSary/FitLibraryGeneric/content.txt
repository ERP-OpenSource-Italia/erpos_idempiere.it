${fitLibrary2} is an extension of ${fitLibrary} that provides support for Java generics.
 * It eliminates the need for ${objectFactoryMethod}s in most cases
 * It is currently complete except for handling application-defined generic classes and methods. This is being added as we speak
 * It will only be made available for general release when that's completed.
