${programmers}
A ${parser} is part of the implementation of ${fitLibrary}

There is a ${parser} for each class or primitive type

For user-defined classes, some of the responsibility is passed to either:
 * The class itself, with ${selfParse}
 * A ${finder}
 * A ${parseDelegate}

The ${parser} is responsible for:
 * Converting the contents of a cell (string or embedded table) into a value of the class or type
 * Comparing two values to see if they match
 * Showing a value as a string
See:
 * .FitLibrary.SpecifiCations.ParserSpecifications
