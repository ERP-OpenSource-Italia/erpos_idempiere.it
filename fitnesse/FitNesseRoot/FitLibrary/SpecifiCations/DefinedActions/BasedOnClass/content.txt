!3 Dynamic Variables may be combined with class-based defined actions to provide OO defined actions
 * This relies on the class of a wiki object being set, as in the example below
 * A class may define a superclass, as with the class Person below
 * A ''oo'' action dispatches on the basis of the class of the wiki object concerned
 * If the defined action is not defined for the class, it looks it up in the superclass, and etc
This approach is only intended for advanced storytest writers.
