 * If a workflow action returns an object, it's wrapped in a new ''!-WorkflowTraverse-!'', so that the object  can be tested in the rest of the table.
 * However, this doesn't apply if the object is any of the following: a Fixture, a Traverse, an array, a Collection, a primitive value or a Value Object.
 * Primitive values include int, boolean, float, double, char, Boolean, Character, as well as all the Number subclasses (Integer, BigDecimal, Byte, Long etc etc).

 * ''appends()'' returns a String, which is not auto-wrapped, and so ''plus()'' is applied to the original ''!-DoFixture-!''
 * ''anotherObject()'' returns a fixture, which is itself not auto-wrapped
 * Now ''plus()'' is not found in that fixture, as it's a method of that new fixture, and so the method in the original ''!-DoFixture-!'' is called instead (outer scope)
 * But ''accessOther()'' is found in that fixture, and so is executed there.
