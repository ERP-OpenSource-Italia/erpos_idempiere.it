 * Write more introductory tutorials
 * Write up the execution model
 * Provide better info on using spreadsheets with folderRunner

Fixtures:
 * Move table lookup from fitLibraryWeb into here

Specification:
 * Change the specs to be explicit about the actions in the class used, and to be chattier about what's going on.
