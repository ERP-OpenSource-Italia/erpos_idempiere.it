${fitLibrary} includes the class ''!-DebugPage-!'' to allow the use of a debugger.

Write your own class to make use of that. For example:
----{{{ public class Debug {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		String url = "http://localhost:8086/";
		String[] pageNames = new String[] {
				"MyProject.MySuite.MyPage"
		};
		new DebugPage(url).runs(pageNames);
	}
}
}}}----
Include the URL for your ''!-FitNesse system-!'', which needs to be running. The ''runs()'' method takes an array of ''!-FitNesse-!'' page names.

''!-DebugPage-!'' retrieves each of the pages through HTTP and runs them through ''!-FitLibraryServer-!'' directly. This means that you can use a debugger, such as in Eclipse, putting in breakpoints, etc in your code.
