A SequenceFixture is exactly the same as a DoFixture, except that ''keywords'' aren't used.

For example, the following SequenceFixture table (and its associated fixture) is a slight reformulation of the first example given in DoFixture:

| !-fitbook.ChatStartSequence-! |

|''connect user''|sarah|

|''user creates room''|sarah|fit|
|''user enters room''|sarah|fit|

|''users in room''|fit|
|''name''|
|sarah|
