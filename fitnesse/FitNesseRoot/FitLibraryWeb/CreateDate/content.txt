Including actual dates in storytests can be a pain, as they need to be changed to make sense.

The ''!-CreateDate-!'' fixture creates dates/times in the past and future, for different time zones. It uses a format to specify the detailed form of the date/time required.

It uses '''Joda Time''': see http://joda-time.sourcefoge.net/
