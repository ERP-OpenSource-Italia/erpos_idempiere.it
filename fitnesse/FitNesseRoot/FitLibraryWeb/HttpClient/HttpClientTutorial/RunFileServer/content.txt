This runs a file server on local port 8093 when you run it as a '''Test'''.

It closes down after the given period in seconds.

!|fitlibrary.server.WebServerForTestingFixture|

|''start file server on port''|8093|''at directory''|!-FitNesseRoot-!|

|''stop testing server after''|60|''seconds''|

Once it stops running, you can run it again.

 * If you run it too soon, it will give an error because the port is already busy.

 * That can happen if you press the back button soon after hitting '''Test''' and press '''Test''' again; the test is still running in the background.

!3 Warning

This file server has limited capability, and is only intended for testing purposes.

While it limits the files that can be accessed to the specified directory, it is not guaranteed to be secure.
