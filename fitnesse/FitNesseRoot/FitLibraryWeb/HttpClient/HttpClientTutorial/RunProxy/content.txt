This runs a proxy server on local port 5555 when you run it as a '''Test'''.

It closes down after the given period in seconds.

|''with fixturing logger''|
|''level''|ALL|

|''start proxy server on port''|5555|

|''stop proxy server after''|60|''seconds''|

Once it stops running, you can run it again (as with the file server).

 * If you run it too soon, it will give an error because the port is already busy.

 * That can happen if you press the back button soon after hitting '''Test''' and press '''Test''' again; the test is still running in the background.

!3 Warning
#
This proxy server has limited capability, and is only intended for testing purposes.
