!3 8. Logging
#
It can sometimes be useful to turn on logging to see what's going on (and when).

Run a different file server on port 8092 [[on this page][<HttpClientTutorial.RunFileServerWithLogging]].

 * This also does logging; it will appear after the final table in the report [[on this page][<HttpClientTutorial.RunFileServerWithLogging]]
 * Run it again if you get a "''Connection refused''" error.

|''with http client''|

 * Turn on logging of the underlying fixtures:

|''with fixturing logger''|
|''level''|ALL|
|''show after''|true|

 * After running the '''Test''', open the folding area called ''Logging'' after the next table:

|''http get''|http://localhost:8092/files/handlingWindows.html|

|'''show'''|''headers''|

|''headers include''|
|''name''|''value''|
|Content-Type|text/html; charset=UTF-8|

|'''show escaped'''|''reply''|
