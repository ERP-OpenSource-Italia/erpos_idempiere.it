!3 5. Matching the request
#
Let's extend the second table, as follow:

|''with mock web services''|

|''mock soap11 on port''|8081|
|''xpath''|//countOf|''is''|Oranges|
|''response''|<count>44</count>|

|''close after''|5|''seconds''|

Now, the response of 44 will only be sent if the request exactly matches "oranges":

 * Try it with OrangesCall.

If the request doesn't match, an error (404) is returned:

 * Try running ApplesCall with it to see this error.

But what if there are several requests, because our system checks regularly for the stock count.

An example of that is on [[this page][RequestSequence]].
