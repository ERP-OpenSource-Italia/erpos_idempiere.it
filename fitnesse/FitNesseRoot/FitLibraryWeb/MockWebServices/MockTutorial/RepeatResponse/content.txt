!3 9. Repeating a response
What if we want the last reponse to be repeated, any number of times. Eg, once the count of oranges gets to 0, it stays at that count:

|''with mock web services''|

|''mock soap11 on port''|8081|
|''xpath''|//countOf|''is''|Oranges|
|''response''|<count>44</count>|
|''response''|<count>23</count>|
|''response''|<count>10</count>|

|''mock soap11 on port''|8081|
|''xpath''|//countOf|''is''|Oranges|
|''response''|<count>0</count>|
|''repeat''|

|''close after''|5|''seconds''|

This will provide a sequence of responses of: 44, 23, 10, 0, 0, 0, ...

Both FourOrangeCalls and FiveOrangeCalls work.

Some others that fail with it: ApplesCall, OrangesCall.

An error will be given if there are fewer than four requests for orange counts, but four or more are permitted.

We can have several services on the same port (and we can have them across ports as well)

An example is [[on this page][SeveralServices]].
