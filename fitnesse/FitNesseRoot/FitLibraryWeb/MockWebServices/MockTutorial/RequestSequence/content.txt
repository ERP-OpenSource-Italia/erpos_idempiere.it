!3 6. A Sequence of Responses for a Request
We can handle a sequence of requests for the stock count for oranges, where the count may change on each request. We extend the second table, as follows:

|''with mock web services''|

|''mock soap11 on port''|8081|
|''xpath''|//countOf|''is''|Oranges|
|''response''|<count>44</count>|
|''response''|<count>23</count>|
|''response''|<count>10</count>|
|''response''|<count>0</count>|

|''close after''|5|''seconds''|

Now, our system will get back responses from 4 requests for oranges: 44, 23, 10, 0.

 * We can try that with FourOrangeCalls

The close will fail unless exactly 4 requests for oranges have been received within the time period.

 * We can try that with too many: FiveOrangeCalls and with too few: OrangesCall

What if we want to provide counts for apples and oranges?

An example is [[on this page][AlternativeRequests]].
