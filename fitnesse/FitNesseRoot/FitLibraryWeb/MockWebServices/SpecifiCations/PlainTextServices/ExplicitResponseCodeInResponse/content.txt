!2 An explicit error code can be provided in any response.
This is useful to mock service calls that fail with various error codes, including a 404 error.

|''mock plain text on port''|8081|
|''matches URL''|/ws|
|''matches request''|in|
|''response code''|300|''with''|out|

 * When we call the web service it fails because of the result code not being 200:

|'''reject'''|''to''|http://localhost:8081/ws|''post text''|in|

|''close''|
