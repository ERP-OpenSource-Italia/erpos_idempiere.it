!3 ''Then'' within a term table defines a required order (a sequence)

 * The requests come in reverse order and therefore the first one fails:

|''mock plain text on port''|8082|
|''matches request''|in|
|''response''|out|
|''then''|
|''matches request''|in2|
|''response''|out2|

|'''reject'''|''to''|http://localhost:8082/ws|''post text''|in2|

|''to''|http://localhost:8082/ws|''post text''|in|'''is'''|out|

|''close with errors''|>=|1|
