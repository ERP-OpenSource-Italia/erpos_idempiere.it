 * With a frameset, the first frame is selected automatically.
 * The current title and url are of that first frame, rather than of the loaded html containing the frameset.

Firefox and htmlunit differ in several ways with frames:
 * The //title of a selected frame and |title| may differ
 * The default frame behaviour may differ
