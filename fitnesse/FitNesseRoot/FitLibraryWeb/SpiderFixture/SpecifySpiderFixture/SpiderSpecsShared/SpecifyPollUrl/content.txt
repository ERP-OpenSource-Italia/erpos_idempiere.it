This special action polls a given url until a condition is satisfied.  Here's an example:

|'''poll url'''|http://localhost|'''until'''|''element''|//div|''exists''|

In general, it is of the form:

|'''poll url'''|http://localhost|'''until'''|''some boolean action''|

The action needs to return a boolean result.

The poll period is defined by the ''poll url timeout'', which can be changed by using the following action:

|''poll url timeout''|1000|

where the timeout period is in milliseconds.
