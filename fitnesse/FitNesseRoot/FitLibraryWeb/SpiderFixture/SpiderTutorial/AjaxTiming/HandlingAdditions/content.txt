Let's run this to see what happens. The explanation is embedded below:

|''define actions at''|.FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.AjaxTiming.HandlingChanges.DefinedActions|

|''ajax on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''get url''|http://localhost:@{fitNessePort}/files/delaysWithAjax.html|

|''checking timeout''|100|

|''click''|addText|

|''text of''|text0|'''is'''|green0|

The above table fails, because spider only waits for 100 milliseconds for an HTML element to appear.

In the following, we try again, but first change spider's ''checking timeout'' to be 2 seconds. So after that, spider will wait up to 6 seconds for it to appear.

|''checking timeout''|2000|

|''get url''|http://localhost:@{fitNessePort}/files/delaysWithAjax.html|

|''click''|addText|

|''text of''|text0|'''is'''|green0|

Yes, so that worked fine. Similar to ''!-FitLibrary's-!'' ''becomes'' timeout:

 * Spider waits until the element appears or until the timeout period has elapsed.
 * So the test will run as quickly as possible when they pass.
 * However, if an element fails to appear, the whole timeout period will be used.

So let's extend the storytest to check the addition of several elements, [[on this page][^SeveralAdditions]]
