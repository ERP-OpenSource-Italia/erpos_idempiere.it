Here's the storytest, with three cells left for you to complete (those marked with "??")

|''define actions at''|.FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.AjaxTiming.HandlingChanges.DefinedActions|

|''ajax on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''becomes timeout''|2000|

|''get url''|http://localhost:@{fitNessePort}/files/delaysWithAjax.html|

|''with''|newOption|''select option''|red|

|''click''|changeOption|

|''option of''|optionUnderChange|'''becomes'''|Red|

|''with''|??|''set text''|Skies are grey|

|''click''|??|

|''text of''|??|'''becomes'''|Skies are grey|

Hint:

 * If you're using ''fireBug'', find out the ''id'' of the HTML elements by right clicking on the element and selecting "''Inspect element''".
 * See [[this page][<SpiderTutorial.StartingWithSpider.UsingXpath]] for help with finding out ''id''s and other ''xpaths''.
 * See <SpiderFixture.DocuMentation.CommandUserGuide for a complete list of all the spider actions.

Let's now look at handling delays in elements being created [[on this page][<AjaxTiming.HandlingAdditions]]
