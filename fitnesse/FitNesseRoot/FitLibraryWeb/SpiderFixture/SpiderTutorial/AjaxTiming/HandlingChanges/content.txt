[[The web page is here.][files/delaysWithAjax.html]]

You may find it convenient to open this page in another window, so you can easily look at it at the same time as the storytests below.

Let's start by seeing it fail. Then we can see how to fix it.

|''define actions at''|.FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.AjaxTiming.HandlingChanges.DefinedActions|

|''ajax on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''get url''|http://localhost:@{fitNessePort}/files/delaysWithAjax.html|

|''title''|'''is'''|Delays With Ajax|

|''with''|newTitle|''set text''|Fancy Title|

|''click''|changeTitle|

|''title''|'''is'''|Fancy Title|

When we run the test, the last table fails, because the title is still the original one.

So we need to allow for the time delay before the change occurs, as we see [[on the next page][^UsingBecomes]]
