Here's the change, which introduces a new ''defined action'', as shown in the last table below.

We've left out the ''!-SpiderFixture-!'' check simply because it takes so long.

If you click to go to the page linked to in the first table, you'll see that the ''defined actions'' have also been reorganised.

If you run this test, you'll also see that "''stop watches''" have been added to give feedback on the time that things take.

 * You may find it useful to use ''stop watches'' in your own tests in the future.

!2 Evolution

That's it for this part. We've seen how ''defined actions'' can evolve as your needs change.

In general, it's not possible to design them all ahead of time. The best way is to evolve them and ''refactor'' them as you go. Yes, this make them like code.
