So we'll introduce a new ''defined action'', called ''check suite at passes'' that takes two arguments, and is used with "!-SpecifySpiderFixture-!" in the last action (table) below..

|''define actions at''|.FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.EvolvingDefinedActions.AddDefinedAction.DefinedActions|

|''suite test on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''check suite''|!-TemplateFixture-!|''passes''|

|''check suite''|!-XmlProcessing-!|''passes''|

|''check suite''|!-SpecifyRadio-!|''at''|!-SpiderFixture.SpecifySpiderFixture.SpiderWithHtmlUnit.SpecifiCations.-!|''passes''|

That all works. But if we look at the second and third ''defined action'', they look rather similar.

So we have repetition in the ''defined actions'' themselves. How do we manage that?

By removing the repetition, as shown [[on this page][RemoveRepetition]].
