The storytest here is exactly the same as the previous page except that the ''defined actions'' are different.

|''define actions at''|.FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.EvolvingDefinedActions.RemoveRepetition.DefinedActions|

|''suite test on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''check suite''|!-TemplateFixture-!|''passes''|

|''check suite''|!-XmlProcessing-!|''passes''|

|''check suite''|!-SpecifyRadio-!|''at''|!-SpiderFixture.SpecifySpiderFixture.SpiderWithHtmlUnit.SpecifiCations.-!|''passes''|

If you run this, you'll see the difference in the first 2 of the last 3 expanded action calls. You can also click on the link to the ''defined actions'' above to take a look.

Let's handle now handle .FitLibraryWeb.CreateDate.DetailedExample. If you click on that link (before coming '''Back'''), you'll see that it's not a "Suite" but a "Test".

Let's see how to do that [[in the next page][AddAnother]].
