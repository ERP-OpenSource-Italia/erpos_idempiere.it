!1 Part Three

Let's now see how ''defined actions'' need to evolve.

Consider the storytest from the previous tutorial:

|''define actions at''|..FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.DefinedActions.UsingDefinedActions.DefinedActions|

|''suite test on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''check suite''|!-TemplateFixture-!|''passes''|

|''check suite''|!-XmlProcessing-!|''passes''|

We'd also like to use it to run some of the ''!-SpiderFixture-!'' storytests, those concerned with radio buttons. We could try using:

|''check suite''|!-SpiderFixture.SpecifySpiderFixture.SpiderWithHtmlUnit.SpecifiCations.SpecifyRadio-!|''passes''|

If you run that, however, you'll see that it fails. That's because the page name is incorrect.

So we need a variation on ''check suite passes'':

 * We need to pass in the "prefix" page as well
 * We need to ignore the ''ignored'' count

Let's do that [[on this page][^AddDefinedAction]].
