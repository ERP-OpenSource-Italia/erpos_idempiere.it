Let's see how to swtich to a window that has no ''target'' name (the white one).

|''define actions at''|.FitLibraryWeb.SpiderFixture.SpiderTutorial.AjaxTiming.HandlingChanges.DefinedActions|

|''ajax on port''|${FITNESSE_PORT}|

|''get url''|http://localhost:@{fitNessePort}/files/handlingWindows.html|

|''text of''|//h1|'''is'''|Handling Windows|

 * Go White. As it has no ''target'' (the second argument to the javascript call), we select it immediately:

|''click and select resulting window''|popupWhite|

|''text of''|//h1|'''is'''|White|

|''select initial window''|

 * Go Blue

|''click''|popupBlue|

|''select window''|window with blue|

|''text of''|//h1|'''is'''|Blue|

 * Go Back to White. As it has no ''target'', we have to select it by some of its contents; here we use the ''title''.

|''select window with''|//title|''as''|!-PopUp White-!|

|''text of''|//h1|'''is'''| White |

 * Close White:

|''close''|

 * Close Blue:

|''select window''|window with blue|

|''close''|

 * So we're back on the initial window
