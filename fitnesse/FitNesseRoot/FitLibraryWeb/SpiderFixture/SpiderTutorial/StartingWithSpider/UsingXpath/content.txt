To check that text more precisely, we'll use ''xpath'' notation to refer to the header element in the html.

To work out the appropriate xpath, we could load the page into a browser and look at the html source. (Eg, in Firefox, select the the '''Page Source''' menu item from the '''View''' menu (or use Ctrl-U)).

However, that's laborious, awkward and error prone. I find the best approach is to use Firefox with two handy plugins:

 * Firebug: install and documentation at http://getfirebug.com
 * xpather: install and documentation at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1192

Start your own copy of Firefox explicitly before installing these; the Firefox copy started by ''!-SpiderFixture-!'' does not have any plugins and shouldn't have them added.
#
!2 Firebug
#
Once you've installed Firebug, select the menu item '''Tools/Firebug/Open Firebug''' within firefox. This opens a panel at the bottom of the firefox window.

Now right-click on the header "!-TemplateFixture-!" at the top of the page and select the menu item '''Inspect Element'''.

You'll see that element of the HTML is high-lighted in the bottom panel as follows:
{{{   <span class="page_title">TemplateFixture</span>
}}}So we have a way of refering to that text, using xpath.
#
!2 XPather
#
To use XPather to pick an xpath to locate that element, right-click on the header again and select '''Show in XPather'''.

This gives us a little window with an ''xpath'' of:
{{{   /html/body/div[2]/div[1]/span
}}}Unfortunately, that's not very helpful, as any change to the structure of the page may mean it no longer works. We're better off locating the element by using the class involved:
{{{   //span[@class="page_title"]
}}}We can check that works, and is unique, by typing it into the top text field of the little XPather window.

It's correct, so let's use it. We'll use the same start to the storytest:
#
!2 Extended Storytest
#
!|fitlibrary.spider.SpiderFixture|

|''start spider with''|firefox|

|''shutdown browser automatically''|false|

|''get url''|http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/FitLibraryWeb.TemplateFixture|

|''title''|'''is'''|!-FitLibraryWeb.TemplateFixture-!|

And now we check the specific text:

|''text of''|//span[@class="page_title"]|'''is'''|!-TemplateFixture-!|
#
!2 xpath
#
For introductions and tutorials on xpath, see:
 * XPath in wikipedia (eg, at http://en.wikipedia.ord/wiki/XPath) for a general introduction
 * http://www.w3schools.com/XPath for tutorials
 * http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath for a detailed reference
 * or google XPath for other resources

Unfortunately, I don't know of any tutorials that are both clear and comprehensive; most just give a few examples and don't explain the generality.

Let's now add the clicking of the '''Suite''' button, as covered [[on this page][ClickingButton]]
