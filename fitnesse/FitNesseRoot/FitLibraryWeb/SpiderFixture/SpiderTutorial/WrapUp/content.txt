!2 Not Covered
#
We haven't covered here (which are covered in the [[Manual][<SpiderFixture.DocuMentation]]):

 * Actions that go ''back'' and ''forward'' between pages
 * Checking and setting cookies
 * Handling frames and iframes
 * Making screen dumps
 * Executing javaScript from within the storytest for specialised actions
 * Accessing element attributes and counting elements
 * Checking for errors in a general way

See the [[Manual][<SpiderFixture.DocuMentation]] and the [[Specs][<SpiderFixture.SpecifySpiderFixture]] for further details and actions.

!2 Xpath Expressions
#
We haven't said much about ''xpath'' expressions.

 * These are important in locating elements.
 * See the resources listed [[here][<SpiderTutorial.StartingWithSpider.UsingXpath]]. Use Xpather and experiment.

!2 Good Luck!
