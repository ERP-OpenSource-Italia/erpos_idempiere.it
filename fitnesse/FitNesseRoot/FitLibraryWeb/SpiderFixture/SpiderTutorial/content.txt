!define tut1 {The basics of using ''!-SpiderFixture-!'' to:

 * Get a page
 * Verify the title
 * Verify the text of an element on the page, located by ''xpath''
 * Click a button, located by the link name
 * Verify the existence of an element, located by ''xpath''

We also introduce the use of ''Firebug'' and ''XPather''.
}
!define tut2 {The basics of creating a domain language to:

 * Avoid duplication
 * Avoid getting lost in the detail.

We introduce ''defined actions''.
}
!define tut3 {Evolving and organising ''defined actions'':

 * A change is needed
 * How to organise more than a few ''defined actions''
}
!define tut4 {Handling Forms:

 * Checking and changing elements on a form
 * Submitting a form
}
!define tut5 {Handling tables (and other structures):

 * How to check the whole contents of a table
 * How to check and change pieces of a table
 * How to find a particular row of a table so that the rest of it can be checked

And how this applies to any HTML elements with sub-structure
}
!define tut6 {Handling windows:

 * How to select a window by name
 * Closing windows
 * How to select a window by its contents
}
!define tut7 {Dealing with delays:

 * Delays in loading a page
 * Delays in changes to the current page due to ajax:
  * There's a delay before an element appears
  * There's a delay before the text, etc of an element changes
  * There's a delay before an element is removed
  * There's a delay before an element is made visible or invisible

Along the way, we also use spider actions to:

 * Change and check ''radio button''s and ''select''s
 * Check for the existence or non-existence of HTML elements

And we touch on handling invisible elements, but don't cover this in detail.
