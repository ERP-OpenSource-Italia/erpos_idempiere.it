Here's some things that we might do:

|Move lookupTable to fitLibrary|''As it's useful more generally''|
|Add help to other fixtures in fitLibraryWeb|''As that may be useful''|

|Consider adding following functionality to Spider|''As webDriver now has more capability that we could support''|
|!-RenderedWebElement-!|For dnd, access to css properties, displayed|
|Alert|For alert accept, dismiss, get and send keys|
|By|by css selector|
|Keyboard|Presumably for finer-scale control of key presses?|
|Mouse|Presumably for finer-scale of mouse|
|...and others?||
