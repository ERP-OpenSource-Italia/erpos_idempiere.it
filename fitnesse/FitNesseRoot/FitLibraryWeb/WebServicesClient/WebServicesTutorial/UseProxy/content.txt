!1 2. Proxy Server
#
In many organisations, it's necessary to access external web sites through a proxy.

 * Then the proxy will be configured in your browser.
 * If it's an authenticating proxy, you may have to log in.

If you're testing, and need to go through a proxy, the ''web services client'' can be configured to use a specified proxy.

 * In this example, we configure it to use a local proxy on port 5555.
 * In your tests, you'd configure it to your own proxy.
#
!3 3. Running a local proxy server
#
We first need to run a proxy server for it to talk to: open [[this page][.FitLibraryWeb.HttpClient.HttpClientTutorial.RunProxy]] in (yet) another browser window.

Both the proxy server and the web service server need to be running for this storytest to pass.

 * If the proxy server is not running, a "''Connection to http://localhost:5555 refused''" error is given.
 * If the proxy server is running, but the file server is not, a "''The target server failed to respond''" error will be given (by the proxy server).

Run the web service server on [[this page][RunWebServiceServer]].
#
!3 4. An example
#
|''with web services client''|

 * Turn on logging of the underlying fixtures:

|''with fixturing logger''|
|''level''|ALL|

 * Specify the proxy to use:

|''proxy url''|localhost|''with port''|5555|

|''to''|http://localhost:8093/ws|''post soap11''|<Count>100</Count>|

|'''show'''|''headers''|

|'''show'''|''reply''|

|'''show escaped'''|''reply''|

|reply|contains|101|

|''xpath''|!-//CountResult-!|''in response''|'''is'''|101|

Finally, [[on this page][OtherCalls]], we look at other ways to call web services.
