Notes
======
* Mapping between selenese ( the native format created by Selenium IDE recording ) and 
  web driver export is not one to one. For e.g, the fireEvent command is not needed in
  web driver test script.

* You must change the "target" instance variable value to "" in the generated ztl java source
