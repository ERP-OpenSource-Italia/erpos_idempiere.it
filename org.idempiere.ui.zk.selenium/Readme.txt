test
- Example test cases written using Selenium Web Driver and Zk JQ selector

Notes
======
* Use the AdempiereIDGenerator and your browser's inspect element tool to find out the selector for the element that you need to access. Alternatively,
you can use the script created from Selenium IDE recording as a guide. 

* For execution of test cases, you don't need AdempiereIDGenerator if you only use zk id instead of uuid(html id)
