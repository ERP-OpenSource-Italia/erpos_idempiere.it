How to add a new WebService in idempiere WebServices

i.e. 
we're going to add a webservice to complete documents
the new webservice will have the following parameters:
* ADLoginRequest - it's already defined in WEB-INF/xsd/idempiere-schema.xsd with the following parameters:
    user, pass, lang, ClientID, RoleID, OrgID, WarehouseID, stage
* TableName  String -> M_InOut
* Record_ID int -> 1000002
* DocStatus String -> CO

Note, if you need to define new datatypes you need to define them in  WEB-INF/xsd/idempiere-schema.xsd
and generate the idempiere-xmlbeans.jar again with this command:
  scomp -out ./WEB-INF/lib/idempiere-xmlbeans.jar ./WEB-INF/xsd/idempiere-schema.xsd
scomp will generate the corresponding classes to manipulate the xml objects from the messages


The method will be called modelSetDocAction - the model in name indicates that the web service is going to be based on model classes, current web services are based in UI instead of model.

So, we add this line:
    public StandardResponseDocument modelSetDocAction(String tableName, int recordID, String newDocStatus, ADLoginRequestDocument reqlogin);
at the interface WEB-INF/src/org/idempiere/adinterface/ADService.java
NOTE: In parameters, complex data must be at the end

Now, we need to implement the method, so we open the file
WEB-INF/src/org/idempiere/adinterface/ADServiceImpl.java

And add the new method and define the corresponding logic within.
